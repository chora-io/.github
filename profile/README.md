# About

We are a small team of researchers, engineers, and creatives who share a mission to explore "outside the city proper" (see [χώρα](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kh%C3%B4ra)). We are currently researching the use of decentralized blockchain protocols for commons governance and ecological regeneration.
