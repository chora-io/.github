# About

We are prototyping software tools and services for commons governance and ecological regeneration. We also run a validator on [Regen](https://www.mintscan.io/regen/validators/regenvaloper1t8p3zdu3h8qzggfmvvvmtdnaj4trcsfh79xp4e) in addition to multiple validators on test networks including Chora Testnet and Regen Redwood.
